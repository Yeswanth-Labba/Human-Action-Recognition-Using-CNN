# Human Action Recognition Using CNN

This project focuses on **human action recognition** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
The model is designed to classify video frames or image sequences into different human activities such as walking, running, jumping, and more.  

### Key Features:
- ðŸ§  Deep learning-based action recognition with CNNs  
- ðŸŽ¥ Frame-level or sequence-based activity classification  
- ðŸ“Š Training, validation, and performance evaluation pipeline  
- ðŸš€ Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, if thatâ€™s what you used)  
- ðŸ“‚ Easily extendable for custom datasets  

### Use Cases:
- Smart surveillance systems  
- Human-computer interaction  
- Sports analytics  
- Healthcare and rehabilitation monitoring
